# Chord Generator

This project was made for the course 'Creative Coding' at Jönköping University, autumn 2023.

The goal with this project is to allow the user to use their own audio device which the system then will interpret and create chords according to the note that the user is inputting.

At the time of writing this (17-10-2023) the project is not working as intended, however, I will continue working on this when I have time until I am satisfied with the outcome.
